# instagram-cover-static-page

This project is a static web page and created by using HTML(Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. HTML defines the structure of a web page by using tags to identify different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to define the presentation of a web page, such as the layout, color, font, and other visual properties)

Static web pages do not have any dynamic content or server-side processing, they are lightweight and load quickly. However, this is limited in terms of interactivity and cannot provide the same level of user engagement and functionality as dynamic web pages.
